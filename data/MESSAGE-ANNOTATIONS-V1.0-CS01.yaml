abstract:
- content: AMQP is a vendor-neutral, platform-agnostic protocol for passing real-time
    data streams and business transactions. This document defines mechanisms to allow
    messages which transit boundaries to be annotated with sufficient information
    to allow responses to be directed back to the intended recipient.
