abstract:
- content: Describes the file format used in a “context/value association” file (termed
    in short as “a CVA file”). This file format is an XML vocabulary using address
    expressions to specify hierarchical document contexts and their associated constraints.
    A document context specifies one or more locations found in an XML document or
    other similarly structured hierarchy of information. A constraint is expressed
    as either an explicit expression evaluation or as a value inclusion in one or
    more controlled vocabularies of values. This file format specification assumes
    a controlled vocabulary of values is expressed in an external resource described
    by the OASIS genericode standard.
