    Describes: .       A semantic (or information) model for exchange of calendar information to coordinate activities .       A means of synchronizing and maintaining calendars
    The specification includes XML vocabularies for the interoperable and standard exchange of:
    .       Schedules, including sequences of schedules
    .       Intervals, including sequences of Intervals
    .       Other calendar information consistent with the IETF iCalendar standards
    These vocabularies describe schedules and Intervals future, present, or past (historical).
    The specification is divided into three parts.
    1) The information model and XML vocabularies for exchanging schedule information
    2) RESTful Services for calendar update and synchronization
    3) Web services for calendar update and synchronization
    The Technical Committee has decided not to publish Parts 2 and 3 until a later version.
