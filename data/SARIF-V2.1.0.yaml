abstract:
- content: To form an overall picture of software quality, developers often need to
    aggregate the results produced by a number of analytical tools, commercial, open
    source, and home grown. SARIF (https://www.oasis-open.org/standard/sarifv2-1-os/)
    defines a standard format for the output of static analysis tools, enabling developers
    to combine the results and more quickly identify problems.
