abstract:
- content: An open internet protocol for business messaging. AMQP defines links as
    a unidirectional transport for messages between a source and a target. The target
    of a link identifies the node to which messages are to be sent to. If a large
    number of distinct destinations are in use, or if the destinations to be sent
    to are not known ahead of time (for example, they are provided as a reply-to in
    incoming messages) then creating a link per destination can be burdensome. This
    document defines a mechanism whereby a single outgoing link can be used to transfer
    messages which are then routed using the address carried in their “to” field.
