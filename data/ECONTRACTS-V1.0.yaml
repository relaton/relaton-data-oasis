abstract:
- content: Describes the generic hierarchical structure of a wide range of contract
    documents. The TC envisages that the primary use of the eContracts Schema will
    be to facilitate the maintenance of precedent or template contract documents and
    contract terms by persons who wish to use them to create new contract documents
    with automated tools. Use cases covered include negotiated business contracts,
    ticket contracts, standard form business and consumer contracts and click-through
    agreements.
