abstract:
- content: Defines a communications-protocol neutral method for exchanging electronic
    business messages. It defines specific Web Services-based enveloping constructs
    supporting reliable, secure delivery of business information. Furthermore, the
    specification defines a flexible enveloping technique, permitting messages to
    contain payloads of any format type. This versatility ensures legacy electronic
    business systems employing traditional syntaxes (i.e. UN/EDIFACT, ASC X12, or
    HL7) can leverage the advantages of the ebXML infrastructure along with users
    of emerging technologies.
