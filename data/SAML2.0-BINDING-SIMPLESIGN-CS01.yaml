abstract:
- content: Defines a SAML HTTP protocol binding, specifically using the HTTP POST
    method, and not using XML Digital Signature for SAML message data origination
    authentication. Rather, a “sign the BLOB” technique is employed wherein a conveyed
    SAML message is treated as a simple octet string if it is signed. Conveyed SAML
    assertions may be individually signed using XMLdsig. Security is optional in this
    binding.
