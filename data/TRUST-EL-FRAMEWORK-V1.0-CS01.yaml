abstract:
- content: Recommends particular methods as satisfying defined degrees of assurance
    for elevating trust in an electronic identity credential, to assure the submitterâ€™s
    identity sufficiently to support elevation between each pair of assurance levels
    to transact business where material amounts of economic value or personally identifiable
    data are involved. Alternative and optional methods may be included. The description
    of each recommended method shall include functional definitions of the types of
    identity and assertion data employed by each method, and may include specification
    of the data services required in each elevation, substantive data exchange patterns
    or models, message exchange patterns or models, and such other elements as the
    TC deems useful.
