abstract:
- content: Defines EI services and operations, XML, service and operation payloads
    and service operation interaction patterns. EI payloads can be exchanged using
    WSDL-based SOAP messages or using other transport protocols. For interoperability,
    any use of other networking technologies should be profiled and standardized.
    This version of this specification specifies standardized exchange of EI messages
    using the AS4 profile of the OASIS ebMS 3.0 OASIS Standard.
