abstract:
- content: Vendors offer tools to facilitate various activities across the life cycle
    of a SOA artifact, such as design, assembly, quality assurance, deployment and
    runtime operation of SOA based applications and business processes.  The lack
    of a standardized information model and interaction protocol for artifacts and
    their metadata residing in a SOA repository means that tools must be customized
    for use with each different vendor’s SOA repository product.  This reduces choice,
    flexibility and adds costs for customers when choosing tools. This specification
    defines a SOA artifact data model together with bindings that describe the syntax
    for interacting with a SOA repository.
