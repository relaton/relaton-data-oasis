abstract:
- content: Vendors offer tools to facilitate various activities across the life cycle
    of a SOA artifact, such as design, assembly, quality assurance, deployment and
    runtime operation of SOA based applications and business processes.  The lack
    of a standardized information model and interaction protocol for artifacts and
    their metadata residing in a SOA repository means that tools must be customized
    for use with each different vendorâ€™s SOA repository product.  This reduces choice,
    flexibility and adds costs for customers when choosing tools. This specification
    defines a SOA artifact data model together with bindings that describe the syntax
    for interacting with a SOA repository.
