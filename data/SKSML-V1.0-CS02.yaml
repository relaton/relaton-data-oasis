abstract:
- content: Defines the first (1.0) version of the Symmetric Key Services Markup Language
    (SKSML), an XML-based messaging protocol, by which applications executing on computing
    devices may request and receive symmetric key-management services from centralized
    key-management servers, securely, over networks. Applications using SKSML are
    expected to either implement the SKSML protocol, or use a software library – called
    the Symmetric Key Client Library (SKCL) – that implements this protocol. SKSML
    messages are transported securely over standard HTTP using XML Security (XML Signature
    and XML Encryption).
