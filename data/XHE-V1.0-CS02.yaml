abstract:
- content: Defines a business-oriented artefact either referencing (as a header) or
    containing (as an envelope) a payload of one or more business documents or other
    artefacts with supplemental semantic information about the collection of payloads
    as a whole. This is distinct from any transport-layer infrastructure header or
    envelope that may be required to propagate documents from one system to another.
    An exchange header envelope describes contextual information important to the
    sender and receiver about the payloads, without having to modify the payloads
    in any fashion.
