abstract:
- content: Defines the artifacts and APIs that need to be offered by a Platform as
    a Service (PaaS) cloud to manage the building, running, administration, monitoring
    and patching of applications in the cloud. Its purpose is to enable interoperability
    among self-service interfaces to PaaS clouds by defining artifacts and formats
    that can be used with any conforming cloud and enable independent vendors to create
    tools and services that interact with any conforming cloud using the defined interfaces.
    Cloud vendors can use these interfaces to develop new PaaS offerings that will
    interact with independently developed tools and components.
