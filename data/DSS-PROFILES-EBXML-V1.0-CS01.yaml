abstract:
- content: Mappings from DSS messages into standard communication protocols are called
    DSS bindings. A transport binding specifies how DSS messages are encoded and carried
    using a transport protocol. The DSS Core standard [DSS Core] specifies two transport
    bindings. This document specifies an alternative transport binding that uses the
    OASIS ebXML Messaging Service. This profile supports is compatible with both the
    version 2.0 [ebMS 2.0] and version 3.0 [ebMS 3.0] ebXML Messaging OASIS standards.
