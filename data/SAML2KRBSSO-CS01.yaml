abstract:
- content: Allows for transport of assertions using the Kerberos subject confirmation
    method by standard HTTP user agents with no modification of client software and
    maximum compatibility with existing deployments.  The flow is similar to standard
    Web Browser SSO, but a Kerberos AP-REQ message is presented by the user agent
    via the HTTP Negotiate authentication scheme and the Kerberos GSS-API mechanism.
    The presentation of a valid Kerberos AP-REQ message whose client principal name
    matches the principal name given in the subject confirmation strengthens the assurance
    of the resulting authentication context and protects against credential theft.
