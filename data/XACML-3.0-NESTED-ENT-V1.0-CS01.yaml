abstract:
- content: It is not unusual for access control policy to be dependent on attributes
    that are not naturally properties of the access subject or resource, but rather
    are properties of entities that are related to the access subject or resource.
    This profile defines the means to reference such attributes from within XACML
    policies for processing by a policy decision point.
