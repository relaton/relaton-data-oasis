    bindings that can be used by applications to work with one or more Content Management
    repositories/systems. The CMIS interface is designed to be layered on top of existing
    Content Management systems and their existing programmatic interfaces. It is not
    intended to prescribe how speciﬁc features should be implemented within those
    CM systems, nor to exhaustively expose all of the CM system’s capabilities through
    the CMIS interfaces. Rather, it is intended to deﬁne a generic/universal set of
    capabilities provided by a CM system and a set of services for working with those
    capabilities.
