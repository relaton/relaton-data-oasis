abstract:
- content: Describes the issuing and processing of holder-of-key SAML assertions.
    Specifically, we show how a SAML issuer binds X.509 data to a  element and how
    a relying party confirms that a  element matches given X.509 data. The binding
    material used by the SAML issuer and the matching data used by the relying party
    are obtained from an X.509 certificate.
