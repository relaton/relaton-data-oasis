abstract:
- content: Deals with problems of decision-making in all manufacturing companies who
    want to have a sophisticated information system for production planning and scheduling.
    PPS specification provides XML schema and communication protocols for information
    exchange among manufacturing application programs in the web-services environment.
    The Core Elements section focuses on information model of core elements which
    can be used as ontology in the production planning and scheduling domain. Since
    the elements have been designed without particular contexts in planning and scheduling,
    they can be used in any specific type of messages as a building block depending
    on the context of application programs. The Transaction Messages section focuses
    on transaction messages that represent domain information sent or received by
    application programs in accordance with the context of the communication, as well
    as transaction rules for contexts such as pushing and pulling of the information
    required. Finally, the Profile Specifications section focuses on profiles of application
    programs that may exchange the messages. Application profile and implementation
    profile are defined. Implementation profile shows capability of application programs
    in terms of services for message exchange, selecting from all exchange items defined
    in the application profile. The profile can be used for definition of a minimum
    level of implementation of application programs which are involved in a community
    of data exchange.
