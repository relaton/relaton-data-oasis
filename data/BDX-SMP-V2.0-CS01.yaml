abstract:
- content: Describes a protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner
    network. In a 4-corner network, entities are exchanging business documents through
    intermediary gateway services (sometimes called Access Points). To successfully
    send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover
    critical metadata about the recipient of the business document, such as types
    of documents the recipient is capable of receiving and methods of transport supported.
    The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the network through
    a Service Metadata Publisher service. This specification describes the request/response
    exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client wishing to discover
    endpoint information. A client can either be an end-user business application
    or a gateway/access point in the 4-corner network. It also defines the request
    processing that must happen at the client.
