abstract:
- content: Defines an extension to the SAML V2.0 protocol specification [SAML2Core]
    that facilitates requests made by parties other than the intended response recipient.
    Protocol extensions enable extension-aware SAML requesters and responders to modify
    protocol behavior in a generic, layered fashion. Readers should be familiar with
    [SAML2Core] before reading this document.
