abstract:
- content: The OASIS ebMS 3.0 Standard combined multiple Web Service standards to
    create a single comprehensive specification for defining the secure and reliable
    exchange of documents using Web Services. The AS4 profile of the ebMS 3.0 specification
    was developed in order to bring continuity to the principles and simplicity that
    made AS2 successful, while adding better compliance to Web Services standards,
    and features such as message pulling capability and a built-in Receipt mechanism.
