abstract:
- content: A concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of
    cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic
    of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms or other aspects
    of the implementation. Stateless packet filtering is a cyber defense mechanism
    that denies or allows traffic based on static properties of the traffic, such
    as address, port, protocol, etc. This profile defines the Actions, Targets, Specifiers
    and Options that are consistent with the version 1.0 of the OpenC2 Language Specification
    ([OpenC2-Lang-v1.0]) in the context of stateless packet filtering (SLPF).
