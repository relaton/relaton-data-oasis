abstract:
- content: Defines a simplified profile of the TOSCA Version 1.0 specification in
    a YAML rendering which is intended to simplify the authoring of TOSCA service
    templates. This profile defines a less verbose and more human-readable YAML rendering,
    reduced level of indirection between different modeling artifacts as well as the
    assumption of a base type system.
