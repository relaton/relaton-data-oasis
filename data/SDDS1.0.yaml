abstract:
- content: 'Defines schema for two XML document types: Package Descriptors and Deployment
    Descriptors. Package Descriptors define characteristics of a package used to deploy
    a solution. Deployment Descriptors define characteristics of the content of a
    solution package, including the requirements that are relevant for creation, configuration
    and maintenance of the solution content. The semantics of the descriptors are
    fully defined, allowing software implementations to precisely understand the intent
    of the descriptor authors and to use the information provided in the descriptors
    to support solution deployment.'
