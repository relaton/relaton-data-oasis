abstract:
- content: Describes the background and purpose of the Election Markup Language, the
    electoral processes from which it derives its structure and the security and audit
    mechanisms it is designed to support. It also provides an explanation of the core
    schemas used throughout, definitions of the simple and complex datatypes, plus
    the EML schemas themselves. It also covers the conventions used in the specification
    and the use of namespaces, as well as the guidance on the constraints, extendibility,
    and splitting of messages.
