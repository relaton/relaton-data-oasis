abstract:
- content: Describes a protocol for publishing service metadata within a 4-corner
    network. In a 4-corner network, entities are exchanging business documents through
    intermediary gateway services (sometimes called Access Points). To successfully
    send a business document in a 4-corner network, an entity must be able to discover
    critical metadata about the recipient (endpoint) of the business document, such
    as types of documents the endpoint is capable of receiving and methods of transport
    supported. The recipient makes this metadata available to other entities in the
    network through a Service Metadata Publisher service. This specification describes
    the request/response exchanges between a Service Metadata Publisher and a client
    wishing to discover endpoint information. A client can either be an end-user business
    application or a gateway/access point in the 4-corner network. It also defines
    the request processing that must happen at the client.
