abstract:
- content: 'Provides the definition of the Atomic Transaction coordination type that
    is to be used with the extensible coordination framework described in WS-Coordination.
    This specification defines three specific agreement coordination protocols for
    the Atomic Transaction coordination type: completion, volatile two-phase commit,
    and durable two-phase commit. Developers can use any or all of these protocols
    when building applications that require consistent agreement on the outcome of
    short-lived distributed activities that have the all-or-nothing property.'
