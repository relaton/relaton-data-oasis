abstract:
- content: A supplement to the ebMS-3 specification [ebMS3]. It defines some conformance
    profiles that support specific messaging styles or context of use. Future releases
    of this document are likely to be augmented with additional conformance profiles
    that reflect the choices or needs of user communities. As a pre-condition to interoperability
    it is necessary for two implementations to agree on which common conformance profile,
    or which compatible conformance profiles, they will comply with. This document
    and its future releases is intended as a medium to publish conformance profiles
    that users and products will claim compliance with.
