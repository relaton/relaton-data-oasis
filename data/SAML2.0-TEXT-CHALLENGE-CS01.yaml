    Covers a subset of challenge/response schemes including those that are based on cryptographic functions and time-based tokens. The notion of text-based challenge/response tokens are not covered by any of the current authentication context definitions.
    This document proposes an authentication context class to cover the general case of text-based challenge/response tokens to facilitate signaling their use in SAML. Such schemes include, for example, scratch tokens, numbered list tokens, grid tokens, etc. associated with a challenge/response authentication function. This document also proposes an extension that enables text-based challenge/response token parameters to be specified in relevant authentication contexts. This extension would be included in the  of such contexts.
