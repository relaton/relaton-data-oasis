abstract:
- content: LegalXML Electronic Court Filing Version 4.1 (ECF v4.1) consists of a set
    of non-proprietary XML and Web Services specifications, along with clarifying
    explanations and amendments to those specifications, that have been added for
    the purpose of promoting interoperability among electronic court filing vendors
    and systems. ECF Version 4.1 is a maintenance release to address several minor
    schema and definition issues identified by implementers of the ECF 4.0 and 4.01
    specifications.
