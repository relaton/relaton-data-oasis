abstract:
- content: Describes the specifications of the “virtio” family of devices. These devices
    are found in virtual environments, yet by design they look like physical devices
    to the guest within the virtual machine – and this document treats them as such.
    This similarity allows the guest to use standard drivers and discovery mechanisms.
    The purpose of virtio and this specification is that virtual environments and
    guests should have a straightforward, efficient, standard and extensible mechanism
    for virtual devices, rather than boutique per-environment or per-OS mechanisms.
