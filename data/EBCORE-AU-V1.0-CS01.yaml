abstract:
- content: Defines message exchanges and an XML schema to support the exchange of
    messaging service communication agreement update requests and the associated responses
    to such requests. The schema offers extensibility for various types of updates.
    The main initial application of the specification is the exchange of X.509 certificates
    for certificate rollover, for which a separate extension schema is provided. The
    specification is based on the concept of messaging service communication agreements
    and the creation of new agreements as independently identified updated copies
    of existing agreements. The specification also provides an Agreement Termination
    feature. The specification supports ebMS2, ebMS3 and AS4 but can also be used
    with other protocols that have a concept of communication agreement. The specification
    is independent of storage or interchange formats for configuration information.
