abstract:
- content: CACAO v2.0 will empower organizations to orchestrate, collaborate, and
    share cybersecurity playbooks. In the ongoing battle against threat actors, organizations
    must identify, create, document, and test various steps to detect, investigate,
    mitigate, and remedy potential threats. The culmination of these steps results
    in a cybersecurity playbook designed to secure organizational systems, networks,
    data, and users.
