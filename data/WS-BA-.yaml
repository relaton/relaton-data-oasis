- content: 'Provides the definition of two Business Activity coordination types: AtomicOutcome
    or MixedOutcome, that are to be used with the extensible coordination framework
    described in the WS-Coordination specification. This specification also defines
    two specific Business Activity agreement coordination protocols for the Business
    Activity coordination types: BusinessAgreementWithParticipantCompletion, and BusinessAgreementWithCoordinatorCompletion.
    Developers can use these protocols when building applications that require consistent
    agreement on the outcome of long-running distributed activities.'
