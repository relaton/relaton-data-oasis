abstract:
- content: Defines an extension to the SAML 2.0 Single Logout Protocol that allows
    the initiator to indicate that it does not expect to receive a response from the
    session authority. This improves user interface interoperability in deployments
    that want the identity provider to control the user experience during logout.
