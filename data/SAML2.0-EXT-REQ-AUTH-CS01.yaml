abstract:
- content: 'Defines a protocol extension to SAML 2.0 specification Error: Reference
    source not found that facilitates a more flexible model for expressing Authentication
    Context than that currently supported. The extension allows service providers
    to express combinations of Authentication Context classes in their requests for
    authentication assertions. The expectation is that the extension, when its additional
    functionality was necessary, would be used in replacement of the existing Authentication
    Context mechanisms in the authentication request message. Readers should be familiar
    with Error: Reference source not found before reading this document.'
