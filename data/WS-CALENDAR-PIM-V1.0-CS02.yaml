- content: |-
    Defines conformance and improves interoperation of calendar and schedule models with each other and with WS-Calendar and Xcal, which are in turn based on IETF RFCs.
    This is a Platform Independent Model under the Object Management Groupâ€™s Model-Driven Architecture. The Platform Dependent Model to which this specification relates is the full model for WS-Calendar as expressed in XML (xCal).
    The focus of this Platform Independent Model is on describing and passing schedule and interval information with information attachments.
