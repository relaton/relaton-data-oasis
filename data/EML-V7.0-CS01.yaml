abstract:
- content: Describes the background and purpose of the Election Markup Language, the
    electoral processes from which it derives its structure and the security and audit
    mechanisms it is designed to support.  It also provides an explanation of the
    core schemas used throughout, definitions of the simple and complex datatypes,
    plus the EML schemas themselves. It also covers the conventions used in the specification
    and the use of namespaces, as well as guidance on the constraints, extensibility,
    and splitting of messages.
