abstract:
- content: A concise and extensible language to enable machine-to-machine communications
    for purposes of command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or
    systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies,
    transport mechanisms or other aspects of the implementation. It should be understood
    that a language such as OpenC2 is necessary but insufficient to enable coordinated
    cyber responses that occur within cyber relevant time. Other aspects of coordinated
    cyber response such as sensing, analytics, and selecting appropriate courses of
    action are beyond the scope of OpenC2.
