abstract:
- content: Provides a standard for quality factors of web services in their development,
    usage and management. Web services usually have distinguished characteristics.
    They are service-oriented, network-based, variously bind-able, loosely-coupled,
    platform independent, and standard-protocol based. As a result, a web service
    system requires its own quality factors unlike installation-based software. For
    instance, as the quality of web services can be altered in real-time according
    to changes by the service provider, considering real-time properties of web services
    is very meaningful in describing the web services quality. This document presents
    the quality factors of web services with definition, classification, and sub-factors
    case by case. For each quality factor, related specifications are cited with a
    brief explanation. This specification can be generally extended to the definition
    of quality of SOA and to provide the foundation for quality in the SOA system.
