    The core OASIS Digital Signature Service webservice [DSSCore] supports the creation of signatures on behalf of applications and / or users by utilizing server-based signature keys.
    This Local Signature Computation profile extends the core functionality such that end users can bring (use) their own (secure) signature-creation device. Examples of such devices are smartcards or usb-tokens but also smartphones, mobile phones, tablets, pcâ€™s or laptops with privately held signature keys.
