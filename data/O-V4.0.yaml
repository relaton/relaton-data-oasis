abstract:
- content: OData enables the creation and consumption of REST-based data services
    which allow resources, identified using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) and defined
    in a data model, to be published and edited by Web clients using simple HTTP messages.
    OData helps create a more open, programmable Web, and simplifies the querying
    and sharing of data across applications for re-use in the enterprise, cloud, and
    mobile devices.
