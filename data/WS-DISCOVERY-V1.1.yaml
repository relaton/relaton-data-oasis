abstract:
- content: Defines a discovery protocol to locate services. In an ad hoc mode of operation,
    probes are sent to a multicast group, and target services that match return a
    response directly to the requester. To scale to a large number of endpoints and
    to extend the reach of the protocol, this protocol defines a managed mode of operation
    and a multicast suppression behavior if a discovery proxy is available on the
    network. To minimize the need for polling, target services that wish to be discovered
    send an announcement when they join and leave the network.
