abstract:
- content: 'A mechanism for the identification of business partners in business documents
    based on XML (or other structured formats) and message headers using URN-based
    identifier types is required in many electronic business exchanges. This specification
    specifies a formal URN-based mechanism for referencing party types from the ISO
    6523, ISO 9735 and ISO 20022 identification scheme catalogs using the oasis URN
    namespace. Sample applications include (but are not limited to): ebXML message
    headers; ebXML collaboration protocol profiles and agreements; UBL, UN/CEFACT
    and OAGIS XML business documents; the UN/CEFACT SBDH; and XBRL documents.'
