abstract:
- content: Defines a profile for the use of XACML in expressing policies that use
    role based access control (RBAC). It extends the XACML Profile for RBAC Version
    1.0 to include a recommended Attribute field for roles, but reduces the scope
    to address only “core” and “hierarchical” RBAC. This specification has also been
    updated to apply to XACML v3.0.
