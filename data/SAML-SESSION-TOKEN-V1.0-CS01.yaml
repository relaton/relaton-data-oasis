abstract:
- content: Web Servers and Application Servers generally maintain security state information
    for currently active users, particularly once some type of authentication has
    occurred. This specification defines a format for communicating such security
    session state based on the OASIS SAML Assertion. It also specifies two different
    mechanisms for communicating this information between servers via a standard Web
    browser.
