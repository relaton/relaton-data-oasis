    Describes a domain-specific policy assertion for WS-ReliableMessaging [WS-RM] that that can be specified within a policy alternative as defined in WS-Policy Framework [WS-Policy].
    By using the XML [XML], SOAP [SOAP 1.1], [SOAP 1.2] and WSDL [WSDL 1.1] extensibility models, the WS* specifications are designed to be composed with each other to provide a rich Web services environment. This by itself does not provide a negotiation solution for Web services. This is a building block that is used in conjunction with other Web service and application-specific protocols to accommodate a wide variety of policy exchange models.
