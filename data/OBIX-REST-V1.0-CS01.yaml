abstract:
- content: Specifies REST bindings for OBIX. OBIX provides the core information model
    and interaction pattern for communication with building control systems. Specific
    implementations of OBIX must choose how to bind OBIX interactions. This document
    describes the REST Binding, an interaction pattern that can be used in conjunction
    with XML, EXI, CoAP, and JSON encodings, as well as other encodings that may be
    specified elsewhere.
