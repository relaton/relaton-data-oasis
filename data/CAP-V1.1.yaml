abstract:
- content: General format for exchanging all-hazard emergency alerts and public warnings
    over all kinds of networks. CAP allows a consistent warning message to be disseminated
    simultaneously over many different warning systems, thus increasing warning effectiveness
    while simplifying the warning task. CAP also facilitates the detection of emerging
    patterns in local warnings of various kinds, such as might indicate an undetected
    hazard or hostile act. And CAP provides a template for effective warning messages
    based on best practices identified in academic research and real-world experience.
