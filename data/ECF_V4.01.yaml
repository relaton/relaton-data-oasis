abstract:
- content: Defines the LegalXML Electronic Court Filing 4.01 (ECF 4.0) specification,
    which consists of a set of non-proprietary XML and Web services specifications,
    along with clarifying explanations and amendments to those specifications, that
    have been added for the purpose of promoting interoperability among electronic
    court filing vendors and systems.  ECF Version 4.01 is a maintenance release to
    address several minor schema and definition issues identified by implementers
    of the ECF 4.0 specification.
