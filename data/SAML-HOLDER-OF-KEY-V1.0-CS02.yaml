abstract:
- content: Allows for transport of holder-of-key assertions by standard HTTP user
    agents with no modification of client software and maximum compatibility with
    existing deployments. The flow is similar to standard Web Browser SSO, but an
    X.509 certificate presented by the user agent via a TLS handshake supplies a key
    to be used in a holder-of-key assertion. Proof of possession of the private key
    corresponding to the public key in the certificate resulting from the TLS handshake
    strengthens the assurance of the resulting authentication context and protects
    against credential theft. Neither the identity provider nor the service provider
    is required to validate the certificate.
